SITE NAME is a free to use online cookbook app focused on Italian cuisine, that presents the user with recipes that have been shared on the
site. The user is able to create a free account, and upon doing so, giving them the ability to add their own recipes to the site, edit those
recipes, and delete those recipes if wanted. They also have the ability to add the ingredients list from a recipe to a shopping list hosted
within their own profile.
