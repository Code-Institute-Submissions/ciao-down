SITE NAME is a free to use online cookbook app focused on Italian cuisine, that presents the user with recipes that have been shared on the
site. The user is able to create a free account, and upon doing so, giving them the ability to add their own recipes to the site, edit those
recipes, and delete those recipes if wanted. They also have the ability to add the ingredients list from a recipe to a shopping list hosted
within their own profile.

## **What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?**
This is my third milestone project where I have designed, created and built a fully Mobile Responsive CRUD Web Application for users to
store and share recipes. The project was built  with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Python, Flask, and MongoDB. The Materialize Framework was
used along side these programming languages to help give the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site is as responsive as possible for use
across various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet and mobile.
Users will be able to register, see their profile, log out and log back in again. Registered users will be able to add new recipes, and use
a toggle switch to show if a recipe is Gluten Free or Vegetarian. Users will be able to editrecipes, but only permitted to edit their own
recipes, as well as the option to delete their own recipes.<br>
My goals were to create a recipe site where users feel comfortable in easily browsing recipes and understanding the breakdown of ingredients
and methods, without having to scroll through masses of content. Some recipe sites already created are too busy and can overwhelm the user,
so this site was created to better a users experience. The target audience for this application is anyone who has an interest or passion for
Italian food, not matter what their age or experience.
